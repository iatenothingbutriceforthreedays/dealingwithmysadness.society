I was sitting opposite her at the lunch table at work, we were eating salmon with salad. We were not talking about much, the conversation was both perfunctory and mundane. “I eat the same breakfast every day,” I told her. She made a face to express her disapproval while she chewed on her food. “Don’t you get depressed if you eat the same thing every day?” She asked.

“I feel depressed most of the time,” I said. She giggled whilst covering her mouth. “What a life!” She said, not realising that I wasn’t joking. She went on to tell me stories from her childhood growing up in China.

“When I was young my mother used to force me to eat a sea cucumber everyday.”

“How old were you?” I asked.

“Maybe... nine years old? Anyway, she used to get me to eat a sea cucumber 
everyday at breakfast because she read online that eating them would make me live 
long and be healthy.”

“Did it work?” I asked.

“I don’t know,” she said.

“You look pretty healthy to me,” I said. Looking back I realise that this might 
have been taken as a compliment, but this was not what I intended.

“Every morning I woke up there was just a sea cucumber waiting for me. It made me 
so angry and sick. So now I can’t eat sea cucumber at all, it makes me feel sick 
because I get reminded of the times when I was a kid and my mum forced me to eat 
them. I can’t even look at them.”

I looked up “sea cucumber” on my phone. They looked phallic. I felt weird 
imagining a nine year old girl in China who was forced to eat these phallic 
looking vegetables every morning. I showed her my phone.

“Is this what you’re talking about?”

“Yuck!” she yelled, and pushed the phone away.

I realised that the twenty eight year old woman sitting opposite me had the nine year old girl living inside her. The traumatic memory had immortalised the little girl in her flesh like an insect trapped in an amber fossil. They now lived side by side, and whenever a sea cucumber appeared the latent girl living inside of her would come out to play. It was both beautiful and unfortunate. At that moment I understood why I always felt like she carried the air and naivety of a child; part of her never grew up. I went home that evening thinking about sea cucumbers. Of course, I too have my own sea cucumbers which have immortalised myself at certain moments in my life. I can’t recall any right now, but I’m sure there’s a few.
 
In this sense everything I have been now constitutes what I am. The self is not a singular object, but rather a collection of many selves, each of which have been created by profound moments. From that day onwards I treated her differently, for part of her was still a nine year old girl, dreading morning.
